Steps to use the script:

After opening the terminal first run this 'python3 main.py'

In the first prompt enter 'v' which is for volume
Then in the second prompt enter 'r' for rectangle. For now this is just a placeholder as after that you can calculates the volume of anything.
Then simply answer the other prompts accordingly. Yes or No for 2, then input the dimensions of the object you're going to calculate the volume of.
